 <p><font color="#808080"><p>Storage as a service (SaaS) is a business model in which a company leases or rents its storage infrastructure to another company or individuals to store data. Small companies and individuals often find this to be a convenient methodology for managing backups, and providing cost savings in personnel, hardware and physical space.
As an alternative to storing magnetic tapes offsite in a vault, IT administrators are meeting their storage and backup needs by service level agreements (SLAs) with an SaaS provider, usually on a cost-per-gigabyte-stored and cost-per-data-transferred basis. The client transfers the data meant for storage to the service provider on a set schedule over the SaaS provider’s wide area network or over the Internet. The storage provider provides the client with the software required to access their stored data. Clients use the software to perform standard tasks associated with storage, including data transfers and data backups. Corrupted or lost company data can easily be restored.

<p><font color="#808080"><p>Containers as a service (CaaS) is a form of container-based virtualization in which container engines, orchestration and the underlying compute resources are delivered to users as a service from a cloud provider. In some cases, CaaS is also used to describe a cloud provider's container support services.With CaaS, users can upload, organize, run, scale, manage and stop containers using a provider's API calls or web portal interface. As is the case with most cloud services, users pay only for the CaaS resources – such as compute instances, load balancing and scheduling capabilities -- that they use.</p></font></div> </div>

 <p><font color="#808080" size=3><p>n an IaaS model, a third-party provider hosts hardware, software, servers, storage and other infrastructure components on behalf of its users. IaaS providers also host users' applications and handle tasks including system maintenance, backup and resiliency planning. 

IaaS platforms offer highly scalable resources that can be adjusted on-demand. This makes IaaS well-suited for workloads that are temporary, experimental or change unexpectedly.

Other characteristics of IaaS environments include the automation of administrative tasks, dynamic scaling, desktop virtualization and policy-based services.

IaaS customers pay on a per-use basis, typically by the hour, week or month. Some providers also charge customers based on the amount of virtual machine space they use. This pay-as-you-go model eliminates the capital expense of deploying in-house hardware and software</p>
<pIf you need a solution that requires custom third party software or multiple applications running on a single machine, then IaaS might be for you. </p></font></div> </div>

This factors out networking, firewalls, related security, etc. from IaaS as is shown in the figure below.

NaaS can include flexible and extended Virtual Private Network (VPN), bandwidth on demand, custom routing, multicast protocols, security firewall, intrustions detection and prevention, Wide Area Network (WAN), content monitoring and filtering, and antivirus. There is no standard specification as to what is included in NaaS. Implementations vary.</p></font></div> </div>

<p><font color="#808080"><p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that delivers applications over the Internet. In a PaaS model, a cloud provider delivers hardware and software tools -- usually those needed for application development -- to its users as a service. A PaaS provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or run a new application.  </p></font></div> </div>
